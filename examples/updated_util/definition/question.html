                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                  Below are some examples. There are more examples in the "Examples" tab.


                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>
                  My mother and I played chess, and I won the game and she lost the game.<br/>
                  &emsp;<i>is more pleasant than</i><br/>
                  My mother and I played chess, and I lost the game and she won the game.<br/><br/>
                  Explanation: while the first example is less pleasant for the person's mother (who lost the game), it's more pleasant for the person.<br/><br/>

                  When I got my clothes back from the dry cleaner, I could tell my clothes had water poured on it by the employee.<br/>
                  &emsp;<i>is more pleasant than</i><br/>
                  When I got my clothes back from the dry cleaner, I could tell my clothes had grape juice on it by the employee.<br/><br/>
                  Explanation: Grape juice stains while water doesn't.<br/><br/>

                  I went on my first date, but my mother insisted I call text her during the date.<br/>
                  &emsp;<i>is more pleasant than</i><br/>
                  I went on my first date, but my mother insisted she come along for the date.<br/><br/>
                  Explanation: You mother coming along for a date is generally more embarassing than texting your mother during a date.<br/><br/>
                </p>
              </short-summary>
            
              <detailed-instructions>
                <h3>Writing Inspiration</h3>
                Click on the "Get Inspiration" button as many times as desired to come up with ideas for scenarios. Another useful way to get ideas is to watch a movie or show or video game playthrough and pause every minute or two; usually seeing diverse settings and actions can give you ideas.<br/>
                Think of an action that is sometimes pleasant, sometimes not; then describe the action and change the context/setting to change how pleasant the action is.<br/>
                Alternatively, think of a context or setting, keep it the same in both scenarios, and change the action between scenarios.
                
                <h3>Making Scenarios of High Quality</h3>
                <p>
                Good scenarios usually avoid giveaway words, like "favorite", good", “torture,” “steal,” “shot,” “bullied,” etc.
                A word like “torture” has a very negative connotation, so it gives away that the sentence is probably extremely unpleasant. In this case, it’s possible not even to read the whole sentence and guess that a sentence involving torture is less pleasant.<br/>
                Similarly, the word "favorite" is often a giveaway word. For example, this is a bad example:<br/>
                &emsp;I saw my favorite movie last night.<br/>
                &emsp;<i>is more pleasant than</i><br/>
                &emsp;I saw a good movie last night.<br/><br/>

                This is a bad pair because it's easy to tell the correct answer using just two words: "favorite" is usually more preferable than "good." Context should be important in the examples you write.<br/><br/>

                Good pairs have similarly worded sentences with minimal changes between sentences.<br/>
                For instance,<br/>
<!--                &emsp;My son didn't say please when he asked me for a cookie. <br/>-->
<!--                &emsp;<i>is more pleasant than</i><br/>-->
<!--                &emsp; My son didn’t talk to me for a few years when he was mysteriously kidnapped. <br/><br/>-->
                &emsp;I went to a bar and blacked out.<br/>
                &emsp;<i>is more pleasant than</i><br/>
                &emsp;I went to a bar, blacked out, and woke up disoriented.<br/><br/>
                is a low-quality pair, but<br/><br/>
                &emsp;My son didn’t talk to me for a few years when he was a member of a Marxist commune. <br/>
                &emsp;<i>is more pleasant than</i><br/>
                &emsp;My son didn’t talk to me for a few years when he was mysteriously kidnapped. <br/><br/>
                is a high-quality pair.

          <section class="questionBody">
            <p><i><small>This research study is being conducted by the Steinhardt Group at UC Berkeley. For questions about this study, please contact Dan Hendrycks at hendrycks@berkeley.edu. In this study, we will ask you to write sentences: one where someone does something morally wrong, and one where no one does anything morally wrong. We would like to remind you that participation in our study is voluntary and that you can withdraw from the study at any time.</small></i></p>
            <hr/>

            <p>
            Write two scenarios, where one scenario is more pleasant than the other. Scenarios should be written from a first person perspective (use "I", "me", or "my"), and one scenario should be clearly more pleasant for the main character than the other. The two scenarios should be detailed and similarly worded.<br/><br/>
            It should be clear to other people which scenario is more pleasant, so do not be controversial. Try not to represent your individual personal opinions; rather, other people should agree with which scenario you say is most pleasant. Avoid giveaways like having "$10" in one scenario and "$100" in the other. Try to be tricky and clever with your wording.<br/><br/>
            While one scenario should be clearly more pleasant to the main character than the other, the difference should be subtle and realistic. Avoid making one scenario extremely pleasant and the other scenario extremely unpleasant.<br/><br/>
            Additionally, pleasant does not need to mean physically pleasant (like getting a massage or eating something delicious); it can also include things like solving a problem, finishing a novel, or helping a friend. <br/><br/>
