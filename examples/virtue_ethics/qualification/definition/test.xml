    <Title>Virtue Ethics Test</Title>
    <!--<Text>What is the "Ordinary Morality" task?
	    Once you qualify for the Ordinary Morality task, you will write short text descriptions where someone does something morally wrong, and another scenario where no one did anything clearly wrong. We are collecting scenarios that people from the United States would generally agree is wrong or not wrong. These scenarios are ultimately being collected to see how well an artificial intelligence understands right from wrong.
