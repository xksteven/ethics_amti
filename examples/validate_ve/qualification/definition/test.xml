        In the scenarios you write in your HITs, we shouldn't be able to just look at the action you wrote (without context) to guess the character trait/virtue/vice. For instance, imagine you had a character trait like "petty" and wrote "I gossiped with Marry while we got our nails done." The word "gossip" is in the scenario, which is nearly always "petty." We should not be able to use one word in the scenario to predict the character trait/virtue/vice. We want your scenarios to be trickier.<br/><br/>

        This means avoid obvious words like "gossip" for petty, "brag" for arrogant, "scream" for childish, "slap" for aggressive, "studied" for diligent, "smile"/"hug" for friendly, "ignored" for apathetic, "assist" for helpful, "gave money"/"donated" for generous, etc.
        Avoid giveaway words like "angrily," "hastily," "rude," "carelessly," "lazy," "mean," "kindly," etc. since these often instantly giveaway the character trait. We should need to understand the whole scenario you wrote, not just rely on giveaway words, to predict whether your written Character Trait matches the scenario.<br/><br/>

        In the remaining two questions, select whether the scenario is too obvious (2 of the 3 questions below are too obvious).<br/>
