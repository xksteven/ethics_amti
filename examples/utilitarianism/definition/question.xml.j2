                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                <!--
                <p>Write a secondSentence request or command. Then write excuses that reasonably or not reasonably override or violate the request or command. Alternatively, write down a role or duty and then write plausible and implausible subresponsibilities. Assume that the excuses are truthful, and just modify whether they are secondSentence. Assume that the original request or command had good intentions.<br/><br/>
                Requests or commands could start with "Could you please..." or "Aren't you supposed to...", for example. Excuses could start with "But..." or "No because...", for example.<br/>
                Role and duty statements could begin with "I am the...", or "I should...", for example. Resulting duties could start with "So I should also..." or "That's why I also...", for example.<br/><br/>

                -->
                First, write a one-sentence scenario involving a person. It should be written from the first person (i.e. use words like “I” and “my”), and should either describe the hypothetical person doing something or someone/something else in the scenario doing something to that person.<br/>

                Next, write four separate sentences that could come after the first sentence, and which describe additional details about the scene that make the person’s experience more or less positive. These details should be subtle, but there should be a clear ranking from “most positive" to “most negative” among the 5 scenarios. Whether the scenarios are more positive or negative should not be too controversial, and should not represent your personal opinions; rather, it should represent what a typical person would experience. For example, “I listened to country music on the radio” is too ambiguous and shouldn’t be included, while “I ate chocolate ice cream on my porch” would count as positive even if you personally dislike chocolate ice cream, since the vast majority of people like it. <br/>

                These scenarios are ultimately being collected to see how well an artificial intelligence understands human values, so try to write thoughtful examples to really test the AI's knowledge of human preferences.<br/><br/>

            <p>
                Step 1. Write a one-sentence scenario involving a person using the word "I" or "me" or "my."<br/><br/>

                Step 2. Write four separate sentences that add additional details to the original scenario you wrote in step 1. These details make the original scenario more pleasant or less pleasant, from the point of view of the main character in the scenario. There should be a clear ranking from “least pleasant/most painful” to “most pleasant/least painful” among the 5 scenarios. Whether the scenarios are more positive or negative should not be too controversial, and should not represent your personal opinions.<br/><br/>

              See examples by clicking the "View Examples" button. The Submit button will work when sentences are long enough. Avoid comparing numbers, and avoid writing things like "it was enjoyable" or "it was annoying." Make sure the most pleasant scenario is at the top. One scenario is identical to the original scenario you wrote. You are ranking the pleasantness according to the person saying "I/me/my."<br/><hr/>
            </p>

            <p>Step 1: Write the original scenario where a person has a positive, neutral, or negative experience:
            <crowd-input id="sentence1" name="sentence1" placeholder="Write from a first person perspective (use I/me/my), but it should be about a typical person, not you personally." pattern=".{30,}" onchange="updateSentence()" required/>
            </p><hr/>
            <!-- make 30, rest 20 -->

            <br/>
            Step 2: Write scenarios that expand on the original scenario, and rank the scenarios in order of pleasantness experienced by the person saying "I/me/my" in the original scenario. Full Scenario 1 should be the most pleasant / least painful.
