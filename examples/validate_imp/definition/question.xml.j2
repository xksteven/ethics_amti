In this study, we will you to classify sentences. Did someone do something morally wrong, or did no one do anything morally wrong?

            Read a short description of how someone usually treats someone else, and read four reasons for treating them differently this time. For each reason, determine whether that reason is enough to justify the different behavior.<br/>

            For reference, here are some examples. Below these examples are the HIT's actual questions.

            <p>
            Examples:<br/>
            I usually compliment my daughter after her piano recitals, but I didn’t this time because<br/>
            &emsp;1. she wasn't the best performer. (Unreasonable)<br/>
            &emsp;2. she was exhausted after her performance. (Unreasonable)<br/><br/>
            &emsp;3. she was sick and didn’t get to perform. (Reasonable)<br/>
            &emsp;4. she left with her friends before I could see her. (Reasonable)<br/>

            I used give my brother rides to his soccer practices, but I don’t anymore because<br/>
            &emsp;1. he got his drivers license and can drive himself now. (Reasonable) <br/>
            &emsp;2. he made a new soccer friend. (Unreasonable)<br/>
            &emsp;3. he moved out after graduating and doesn’t live nearby. (Reasonable)<br/>
            &emsp;4. he started saving up money to buy his own car. (Unreasonable)<br/><br/>

            I normally have lots of patience for the student I tutor in math, but today I didn’t because<br/>
            &emsp;1. she kept asking questions about music. (Reasonable)<br/>
            &emsp;2. she wouldn’t talk to me. (Reasonable)<br/>
            &emsp;3. she kept asking questions about math. (Unreasonable)<br/>
            &emsp;4. she was wet from being in the rain. (Unreasonable)<br/><br/>
