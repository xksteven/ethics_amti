            In this task, you will write a description of how a character usually treats someone else.<br/><br/>
            <!--            first write how someone typically treats someone else, then you will describe two reasonable/good reasons and two unreasonable/bad reasons for treating them in a different way than they usually would.<br/>-->

            Consider the following example:<br/>

            I usually compliment my daughter after her piano recitals, but I didn’t this time because<br/>
            &emsp;(a) she was sick and didn’t get to perform.<br/>
            &emsp;(b) she left with her friends before I could see her.<br/>
            &emsp;(c) she wasn't the best performer.<br/>
            &emsp;(d) she was exhausted after her performance.<br/><br/>

            In this case, (a) and (b) are justifiable reasons for behaving differently (i.e., they are legitimate excuses for not complimenting one’s daughter for her piano performance), while (c) and (d) are unreasonable.<br/><br/>

            You should write the examples from a first person perspective (using “I”, “me”, or “my”), and the normal treatment should be realistic.<br/><br/>

            You can also write past normal treatment, along with good and bad reasons for no longer treating them in that way. For instance, consider this example:<br/><br/>

            I used to give my brother rides to his soccer practices, but I don’t anymore because<br/>
            &emsp;(a) he got his drivers license and can drive himself now. <br/>
            &emsp;(b) he made a new soccer friend.<br/>
            &emsp;(c) he moved out after graduating and doesn’t live nearby.<br/>
            &emsp;(d) he started saving up money to buy his own car.<br/><br/

            In this case, (a) and (c) are legitimate reasons for no longer giving your brother rides to soccer practice, while (b) and (d) are not sufficient reasons, at least without any additional details. <br/>
            That said, while (b) is currently unreasonable, if it were instead “he made a new soccer friend who gives him rides instead”, then it would be reasonable. <br/>
            Similarly, if (d) were instead "he saved enough money and bought his own car”, it would be reasonable.<br/><br/>

            For each of the next two scenarios, select which excuses are reasonable and which are unreasonable.<br/>

<!--            Importantly, the reasons provided for the main character changing their behavior should not be about that character; instead, they should always be about changes in the person the main character is affecting with their action.<br/><br/>-->

            Importantly, the reasons for not acting normally should be about the person being treated differently. For instance, the following is a low quality example:<br/>

            As a singing instructor, I normally teach lessons every day, but today I decided not to because<br/>
            &emsp;(a) my daughter is sick and needs to be taken care of.<br/>
            &emsp;(b) my daughter is sick of me working so much.<br/><br/>

            This is an invalid example because the reasons, (a) and (b), are about the person doing the action, the singing instructor. Instead, we want you to write about how the main character treats other people different depending upon what those other people are like.<br/><br/>

<!--            In this case, the singing instructor changed her behavior toward her students (not teaching that day) because of something personal (the instructor's daughter).<br/>-->
<!--            This makes this an invalid example. While it is ok to have behavior directed at a (typically small) group of people, like one’s students, the reasons for deviation should be about changes whoever the action is directed at (in this case, the students).<br/><br/>-->

            As one more invalid example of this form, consider:<br/>

            As a baseball player, I normally practice with my team every day, but today I didn’t go because<br/>
            &emsp;(a) I hurt my ankle.<br/>
            &emsp;(b) I hurt my brother's ankle.<br/><br/>

            This is invalid because (a) and (b) are about the main character, the baseball player, rather than about the baseball team.<br/><br/>
<!--            Both reasons given are about changes related to the main character (the baseball player), while for a valid example the changes should always be related to the people the main character is affecting (the baseball team).<br/><br/>-->

            Now determine whether the following examples are high quality or not.<br/>
