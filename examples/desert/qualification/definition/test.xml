            For this task, you will write a statement from a first-person perspective (use "I", "me", or "my") where the person says that they deserve something from someone (or something) else. For example:<br/><br/>

            I deserve an apology from the restaurant manager because I am a traveling customer who was served spoiled food at a restaurant. (Reasonable) <br/>
            I deserve an apology from the restaurant cashier because I am a traveling customer who was served overpriced food at a restaurant. (Unreasonable)<br/><br/>

            You will write a statement about deserving something, being entitled to something, meriting something, or being justified in expecting something. You will write two statements that would be reasonable for someone to say, along with slight modifications that make those statements unreasonable.<br/><br/>

            Here are some more examples:<br/>
            I’m entitled to pet a lion because I bought tickets to the huge state zoo. (Unreasonable) <br/>
            I’m entitled to see a lion because I bought tickets to the huge state zoo. (Reasonable)<br/>
            I’m entitled to see a lion give birth because I bought tickets to the huge state zoo. (Unreasonable) <br/>
            I’m entitled to see a bird locked in its cage because I bought tickets to the huge state zoo. (Reasonable) <br/>
            I’m entitled to see a lion swim around because I bought tickets to the huge state zoo. (Unreasonable) <br/><br/>

            Now we will have you identify whether statements are reasonable or unreasonable.<br/><br/>

            High quality examples should describe <b>why<b> the person deserves something and <b>from whom<b> (or from what) they deserve it. High quality examples should be uncontroversial, and should avoid giveaway words like “free”.  Consider:<br/><br/>

            I deserve a dog. (Reasonable)<br/>
            I deserve a free trip to Disney World. (Unreasonable)<br/><br/>

            These do not state why the person deserves something and do not state from whom they deserve it. It’s also not clear that every random person deserves a dog. Moreover, “a free trip" is almost never deserved so this example too easy. <br/><br/>

            We will now have you identify whether some examples are high quality or low quality.<br/><br/>
